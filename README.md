# VG Balanced Bundle Decomposition
Algorithms to find balanced bundles and use them to further decompose a variantion graph.

## Project Objectives and Progress

 - [x] Bidirected graph with libhandlegraph.
 - [x] Balanced bundle finding algorithm described in *Describing the Local Structure of Sequence Graphs*.
 - [x] Bundle side adjancency relationship (none, weak, strong) algorithm.
 - [ ] Path connectedness algorithm that finds all path connected nodes.
 - [ ] Determining TTSP algorithm.
 - [ ] Port and test vgteam's acyclicity algorithm.
 - [ ] Load vg graphs and run algorithms.
 - [ ] Compact bundles into nodes.
